# DATA DICTIONARY

> Please note that the descriptions for the metrics derived from the ESPN database are not provided. I have used Claude Sonnet 3.5, which I have configured as an assistant specialized in data analysis and rugby, to provide the initial descriptive information for the metrics. I then carefully reviewed and validated each description based on my own knowledge as a sport scientist, and by cross-checking the information with various rugby-related sources, such as:
> - [World Rugby Game Analysis Definitions](https://www.world.rugby/the-game/game-analysis/definitions)
> - [Wikipedia Glossary of Rugby League Terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_rugby_league_terms)
> - [Wikipedia Rugby League Gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league_gameplay)
> - [ESPN Scrum - Rugby](http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/page/97263.html#)


The `Validity` column indicates my confidence in the accuracy of the descriptions, with ‚úÖ representing high confidence and ‚ö†Ô∏è representing lower confidence. Given my limited experience in rugby, these descriptions may not be entirely accurate, **so please feel free to provide feedback and corrections**.

| `runs`                   | The number of times a player carries the ball during a match. This metric is essential for assessing a player's involvement in offensive plays and their ability to advance the ball, and contribute to the team's attacking momentum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ‚úÖ        |

| `attackingKicks`         | Refer to strategic kicks executed with the intention of advancing the ball into the opponent's territory to create scoring opportunities or gain territorial advantage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ‚úÖ        |
| `offload`                | When a player throws the ball whilst in the process of being tackled. In an event where a player who has brought to ground and manages to pass the ball away before a ruck is formed is also deemed to have completed an offload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ‚úÖ        |
| `cleanBreaks`            | The number of times a player successfully breaks through the defensive line, gaining significant ground before being tackled or running into open space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ‚úÖ        |
| `defendersBeaten`        | The count of defenders a player actively evades or fends off during carries or ball progression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ‚úÖ        |
| `breakAssist`            | When a player provides a pass, offload, or other action that directly leads to a teammate making a clean break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ‚úÖ        |
| `carriesMetres`          | Carries Metres is an offensive metric in rugby that measures the total distance (in meters) a player or team advances the ball while carrying it during the match. This metric is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness and impact of players in advancing the ball through direct runs, contributing to the team's offensive momentum. **This variable is a duplicate of the `meters` variable.**                                                                       | ‚úÖ        |
| `gainLine`               | The gain line is an imaginary line across the rugby field that represents the point where the ball is situated at the start of a phase of play. "Crossing the gain line" occurs when the ball carrier advances the ball past this line, creating positive momentum for the attacking team and putting pressure on the defense. Metrics related to the gain line typically measure the effectiveness of a team or player's ability to progress beyond this line during play. | ‚úÖ        |
| `carriesCrossedGainLine` | The number of times a player carries the ball and successfully progresses beyond the gain line. The gain line is an imaginary line across the field at the point where the play-the-ball occurs. Successfully crossing this line indicates effective forward momentum and penetration of the defense.                                                                                                                                                                       | ‚úÖ        |
| `carriesNotMadeGainLine` | The number of times a player carries the ball but fails to progress beyond the gain line, resulting in being tackled or stopped at or behind the gain line. This metric highlights the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the player's carrying ability and the defense's strength.                                                                                                                                                                                         | ‚úÖ        |
| `carriesSupport`         | Instances where a player receives a pass and carries the ball after a teammate has crossed the gain line or broken through the defensive line. This shows the player's ability to support and maintain offensive momentum created by the initial break or advance.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ‚úÖ        |
| `averageGain`            | The average distance a player progresses the ball per carry. This metric is calculated by dividing the total meters gained by the number of carries. It provides insight into a player's efficiency in advancing the ball during gameplay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ‚úÖ        |
| `dummyHalfMetres`        | The total meters gained by a player running from the dummy half position. This position is crucial for initiating quick offensive plays directly from the ruck, often catching the defense off-guard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ‚ö†Ô∏è        |
| `hitUps`                 | The number of times a player performs a hit-up. Hit-up is the act of taking a pass from the dummy half and running straight into the opposition's defensive line without looking to pass. Hit-ups are usually employed to gain low-risk metres early in the tackle-count, but a good hit-up can also result in a breach of the defensive line. This metric measures a player's ability to gain ground and break through tackles using physical strength.                    | ‚úÖ        |
| `hitUpMetres`            | The total meters gained through hit-ups. Hit-up is the act of taking a pass from the dummy half and running straight into the opposition's defensive line without looking to pass. Hit-ups are usually employed to gain low-risk metres early in the tackle-count, but a good hit-up can also result in a breach of the defensive line.
